      Dr. Norman Borlaug, third from the left, trains biologists in Mexico on how to increase wheat yields — 
      part of his life-long war on hunger.

      <h2>Here's a timeline of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>1984</strong> – Becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University.</li>
        <li><strong>2005</strong> – Advocates for genetically modified crops as a solution to feed the growing world population.</li>
        <li><strong>2009</strong> – Passes away at the age of 95.</li>
